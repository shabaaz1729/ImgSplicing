# ImgSplicing
Image Splicing Detection

In this project we have used deep learning techniques to classify spliced images. 

# Feature Extraction :

We have extracted HOG features and GLCM Texture Features and generated a feature vector of 23 values.

# Following are the classifiers we used :

1.Perceptron

2.Sigmoid Neuron

3.Feed Forward Neural Network

# Dataset

We have trained and tested our model using the images from DVMM, Columbia University.
The dataset consists of 933 authentic and 912 spliced images.
